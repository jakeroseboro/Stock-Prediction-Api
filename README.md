# Stock-Prediction-Api

#### This is a Flask API that takes in stock data based on a query and outputs the predicted closing price of the stock for the next day

#### The prediction is done with sklearn random forest regressor

#### This app could be hosted on heroku and used as a back-end for a stock prediction app

#### The prediction is limited in accuracy, as the stock market has a lot of external factors.
